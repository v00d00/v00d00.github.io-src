The sysinfo:/ kioslave (aka “My Computer”) in konqueror is one of my
favourite KDE3.5 features, I saw that SuSE and Fedora had this working
so decided to “port” it over to sabayon, so after a few hours of playing
around (my term for Sabayon work lol) there is one more thing off `my
list <http://main.v00d00.net/holiday-sabayon-5-kde-4-3>`__, w00t.  Got
that sorted yesterday, after a little patch to get it to compile and
some custom artwork the result is shown at the bottom of this page:

Got a list of more stuff to-do however, =D.

If you are wondering about the network status, it picks it up from
network manager, I use wicd, so thats not showing up. Its on the overlay
now so if you want to try it, or if joost\_op is awake you could use
equo, this will be added to branch 5 only.

::

    equo install kio-sysinfo

or

::

    emerge  -av kio-sysinfo

On an unrelated note if anyone has an ATI (r600+) which they would like
to donate, that would be great. I'm a Nvidia user personally but have
been wanting to test ATi stuff.
