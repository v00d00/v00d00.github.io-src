So its been a while since I’ve blogged so I thought I would take some
time to let you know whats happening in Sabyon-dev-land.

Limbo users will have noticed lots of cool stuff has been added
including the Phoronix Test Suite, KDE4.4RC, Emesene 1.6 as well as the
usual swathes of updates. These updates  will ofcourse mature into
Sabayon 5.2, so what can you expect? Highlights are:

-  Sabayon 2.6.32 kernel
-  Xorg 1.7
-  KDE 4.4
-  GRUB2
-  Smaller ISOs due to dependency clean-ups
-  Sexy new theme
-  And More!

A 5.2 beta is due to be created soon and given out to our testers team, 
the the main hold up is due to ATI not releasing a driver compatible
with Xorg 1.7, we are undecided whether we are going to drop the binary
ati-drivers in favour of the more reliable as nearly as complete open
source ati driver, your opinion is needed here :).

So many things to look forward to there. We are looking for suggestions
on ways to improve the disks so post a comment if you have a wishlist!
