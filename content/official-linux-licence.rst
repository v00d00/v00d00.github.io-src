|Registered Trademark|\ The Sabayon Foundation has just had an official
sub-license granted for our use of Linux(R) as part of "Sabayon Linux" &
"SabayonLinux", covering goods and services on every corner of the
planet (including Antarctica!).

Linux is of course a trademark of Linus Torvalds and the Linux
Foundation can provide everyone who uses the trademark as part of their
product with a license to use it in countries where it is trademarked.
This is a good deal for everyone involved as it means that Company X can
no go using the Linux name for crappy products and services.

And so Linux(R) License No. **20110410-0332** is for Sabayon.

I feel that I should mention a video by Jon "maddog" Hall, of his
keynote at CeBIT earlier this year called "The Hidden Costs of Closed
Source Software", the inital part of which originally raised to fact
that we had not in fact registered our use of Linux! Its a very
interesting video and Maddog puts his points across fairly without going
to GNUCrazy...
