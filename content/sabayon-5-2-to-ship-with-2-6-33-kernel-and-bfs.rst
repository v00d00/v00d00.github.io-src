With Sabayon fever reaching boiling point I have some cool news to break
to you all, which, as you have guessed from the title is that Sabayon

BFS).

Sabayon has a reputation for pushing new desktop technologies into the
forefront of Linux and this move will continue on that path, the
announcement

end of March.
