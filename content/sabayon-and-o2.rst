Well during my usual perusal of Linux based sites one particular article
took my eye, it was `Linux Magazines Gentoo Optimizations
Benchmarked <http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7574/1/>`__.

It shows, in my opinion quite comprehensively, the advantage of a Gentoo
base system with the latest kernel and I reccomend you check out the
figures for yourself.

The article states that big gains can be made but is it worth the time?
I say no, use entropy and get the best of both worlds!

Oh, you can find the entropy make.conf `on any entropy
mirror <http://pkg.sabayonlinux.org/standard/sabayonlinux.org/database/x86/5/make.conf>`__,
if you want to take a look at the setup we use to build entropy
packages.

P.S. Kororaa Linux was not the first LiveCD w/ 3D desktop effects, that
would be Sabayon (ofcourse!), Chris knows this, we have emails to prove
it also, so he should really change his little bio on that site.
