Recently I seem to have been neglecting my blog a bit, I will try to
keep it more regularly updated from now on.

The next Sabayon Linux release will be 5.4 as usual it will have the
usual skew of package updates and bug fixes. We are tracking the bugs
earmarked for fixing before 5.4 using the `Sabayon 5.4 Tracking
Bug <http://bugs.sabayon.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1575>`__. This means that
you can see which bugs will be fixed for 5.4 and the status of each
issue individually; it also means you can report bugs and we can easily
target those before each release. This is a new public approach for to
nailing down issues before release and is due in part to structural
changes within the Sabayon testers group.

Previously the Sabayon testers team (who are one of Sabayon’s most
valuable assets) had a closed mailing list and IRC channel, as of this
week both of these are being closed and all activity will be moved over
to the existing public infrastructure of the
`Sabayon-dev <http://lists.sabayon.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/devel>`__
mailing list and #Sabayon-dev IRC channel on freenode. The ‘opening up’
of the process was done to improve communication with the wider
community, ideally it will  get some more testers involved in testing
and encourage more widespread input on the varying aspects of the the
distribution. If you want to get involved, just grab one of the Sabayon
daily images and hop on the `devel mailing
list <http://lists.sabayon.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/devel>`__ with
any issues.

I have decided to pick my artwork duties back up for 5.4 (as no else has
volunteered to do art!) which means I can also reveal some things
regarding the theme for 5.4. Firstly there will be a new theme which
shares a colour scheme with the current 5.x theme, hooray! Secondly, the
Sabayon “hens foot” logo will be brought back as the official Sabayon
logo! Woot! There will also be a brand new KDM theme and wider KDE will
be getting some theming love too.

In conclusion then, there is a lot to look forward to in Sabayon Linux
5.4, stay tuned for more information.
