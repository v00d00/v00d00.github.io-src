Im back! woot. After a week of holiday its good to get involved again
with some Sabayon stuff. Holiday was nice got to see the Folks and have
a bit of a computer detox! Im surprised I survived so long with no
linuxiness to be honest.

So I come back and the branch 5 situation has changed a bit, (which 100+
testers/devel mailing list messages attest too) the 5.0 Beta1 iso has
been pushed out to the testers and then lxnay decides its a good time
for a holiday (good timing perhaps?). There seems to be the usual mixed
issues with the first ISO spin, most issues now seem to be handled by
improved entropy and migration scripts, branch 5 is shaping up nicely.

Ive switched to KDE4.3 from Gnome, So expect to see a much more polished
and enhanced KDE (as you did with gnome when I switched to that) in the
next release, things on KDE todo list are:

#. New QT theme (10% Done)
#. Getting sysinfo:// working (100% Done)
#. Getting sysinfo:// customised (15% Done)
#. Kicker Customisation (SL Logos etc)
#. Skel Cleanup
#. Sabayon XDG Menus Improve KDE Compat
#. Etc etcâ€¦

Feel free to add anything you want done to KDE in the comments and Ill
incorporate them if appropriate.

Next post has 5.0\_beta2 theme previews!
