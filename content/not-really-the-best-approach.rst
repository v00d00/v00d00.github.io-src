Today I stumbled across `Netrunner GNU/Linux Community
Distro <http://www.netrunner-os.com/>`__ and it made me wonder about a
few things.

Originally, it was Ubuntu with out the "evil Mono(tm)", now of course
mainline Ubuntu has no mono either, so their USP was gone! So they
changed their main idea.

The latest release is based on Kubuntu (which makes it a 4th generation
distro) and aims to improve the KDE that is provided by Kubuntu by, this
is what really got me, integrating more of Gnome into KDE.

Yes, really. Dolphin for instance is replaced by Nautilus, because
Nautilus is more "Feature complete".  I'm not sure how they came to that
conclusion at all and especially within KDE Dolphin really shines, its
integration with tech like Nepomuk and friends is a big plus.

In fact, which missing features of Dolphin? You mean the integrated
terminal? No forced breadcrumb navigation? On wait, they are things
Dolphin can do and Nautilus can't. If anything, nautilus is getting
worse, espesially with Gnome's ongoing war against features that could
confuse anyone with less mental power than a domesticated turkey.

(Domesticated Turkey fact: Young Turkeys don't know how to eat. Turkey
farmers make use of the chick's natural attraction to bright colours:
marbles or strips of foil are placed into their food, or their food is
sprayed with green food colouring. In pecking at the colours, the
turkeys learn to eat. )

One idea on their suggestions forum was to ship Windows apps
pre-installed, uTorrent in fact. Native applications aren't feature
complete either?.

I suppose this is the strength of Linux - if you are looking for a Linux
flavour for any particular purpose there will be one available -  even
if what you want is a KDE/Gnome/Windows cross-breed Mongrel.
