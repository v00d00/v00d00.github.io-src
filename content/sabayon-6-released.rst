We're once again here to announce the immediate availability of Sabayon
6, one of the biggest milestone in our project. Letting bleeding edge
and reliability to coexist is the most outstanding challenge our users,
our team, is faced every day.

There you have it, shining at full bright, for your home computer, your
laptop and your home servers.

Because we do care about our community, we do listen to our users, we
consider them part of the game, we decided to leave GNOME3 out for
another, last, release cycle, in order let things to settle down:
providing a broken user experience has never been in our plans.

Besides, what do we have under the hood this round? Let's go ahead and
see.

  here <http://www.sabayon.org/donate>`__, we still need your support.
| Thanks to your donations, we were able to buy a new development
  server, but we need more I/O speed now!
