hought I would share a little IRC session that me laugh.

Oh, and if you want useful information on Sabayon 5, please see
`Wolfden’s very useful planet post, inc pretty
screenshots <http://wgo.wolf911.us/?p=226>`__

This is the kind of thing that you see and dont expect it to happen to
you! Ahh IRC.

Please join us on #sabayon on irc.freenode.net for sabayon help and to
hang out with cool people like rakuen, lxnay, joost\_op, DHalens,
Azerthoth, tangent, wolfden and ofcourse Thev00d00.

Without further ado:

::

    <Thev00d00> rakuen--: /etc/init.d/net.eth0 zap

    <rakuen--> "Starting ifplugd on eth0...OK, Bakcgrounding... , *WARNING: net.eth0 has started, but is inactive"
    <rakuen--> Thev00d00 I don't understand the question
    <Thev00d00> rakuen--: what lan chip have you got?
    <Thev00d00> rakuen--: /etc/init.d/eth0 stop

    <Thev00d00> rakuen--: dhclient eth0
    <rakuen--> ended with: NO DHCP0FERS recieved. No working leases in persistent database - sleeping.
    <Thev00d00> rakuen--: is it plugged in?
    <rakuen--> no, I am using it to this computer (...) wait a moment
    <Thev00d00> OMG
    <Thev00d00> =0

Also I love people who say “pacific” instead of “specific”. Makes me
fuzzy inside. I wonder if they realise.
