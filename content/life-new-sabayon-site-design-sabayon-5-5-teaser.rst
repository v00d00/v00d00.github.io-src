So what have I been up to lately? Well, I have recently got a nice new
job with a local ex-ISP turned "cloud services" provider so I'm looking
forward to jumping into the new role which, I hope, will be far more
interesting as it will unleash my passion for Linux in a commercial
environment. I've been a bit less active on the Sabayon front because of
the job hunting and such but should increase again soon.

One of the things I've been working on is the Sabayon website design,
the plan is to provide the whole portal and services with a uniform
clean look that is more accessible and easy to use. I've attached a
screenshot of the homepage draft design, feedback as always is
encouraged.

I have moved `bugs.sabayon.org <http://bugs.sabayon.org>`__ to the
`Bugzilla.git
repository <http://gitweb.sabayon.org/?p=bugzilla.git;a=summary>`__ but
have not been able to work on the new styling for a while which is a
shame however its high on my todo list.

I've also been improving some of my various other projects, for instance
the IRC bot ParkerBeta on the #Sabayon IRC channels on Freenode, the
facts database module recently got an update to enable to the deletion
of particular numbered entries on entries with multiple output. The not
so functional Entropy module is getting a major update to use another of
my recently started projects a
`JSON <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON>`__ API for entropy, its
currently in the very early stages, but when finished should allow lots
of cool stuff to built on top of it, think nice AJAX web interfaces etc.

So finally: Sabayon 5.5 may or may not be planned for around Christmas.
