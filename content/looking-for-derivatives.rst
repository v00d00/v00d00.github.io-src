A quick call for anyone who has created a Sabayon derivative or spin
that is publicly available.

I am currently adding a derivatives section on the new site and it
looking a bit bare, so if you would like the possibility of some more
hits for your Sabayon based distro, please `contact
me <mailto:ian.whyman@sabayon.org>`__ with details. Please include a
project name, homepage and short description.

Thanks!
