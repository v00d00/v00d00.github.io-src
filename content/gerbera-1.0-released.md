I am proud to announce the first release of the Gerbera media server!

There have been over 340 commits since the last commit on the MediaTomb git. These including porting the build system to cmake, removing lots of bundled code (including libupnp itself), replacing spidermonkey with duktape, code housekeeping, album artwork support, bugfixes and more.

A a lot of work done, but much much more is still to do!

This release is so we can get the code into the hands of more people for wider testing, hopefully to get packages built for a range of distributions and get even more testing and (hopefully) pull requests as a result üëç

Huge thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release, including the original MediaTomb authors for creating such a great project.
