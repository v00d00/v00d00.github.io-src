:status: published

After several weeks of testing and ironing, we are happy to announce the
public availability of daily (or nightly if you prefer) Sabayon Linux
(Standard and CoreCD editions) ISO images. The aim is to improve
packages and general system functionality testing during releases
lifecycle by providing always up-to-date installable LiveDVDs/LiveCDs.

Our stable releases are just "snapshots" of these ISO images, so you
will be able to know (and report) about possible hardware, software
issue before a new version is published.

Features of Sabayon DAILY ISO images:

-  Up-to-date packages (ISO images are built every night)
-  Featuring the new `Anaconda
   Installer <http://planet.sabayon.org/?s=anaconda>`__ port
-  Speed improvements over 5.2 ISO images
-  Fully compliant with our rolling-distro philosophy, keep looking
   ahead

Minimum Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See respective Press Releases. Got a PC, keyboard and monitor? That's
enough!

Warning, this is the bleeding edge of bleeding edge, do not use them on
production systems.

ISO file names do not expose a timestamp directly, but
RELEASE\_DATE\_DAILY does, as well as ISO boot menu and BUILD\_INFO
inside the ISO image filesystem.
